A very partial start on a book on creating apps using a live code approach -- feedback driven development. 
GTK + Lua + Scheme on Ubuntu, NU + Pixate on Mac/iOS and a as of yet a unknown tech solution on Windows.

I'm making notes as I code [sqircleapp](http://sqircleapp.com) and it will be turned into a book 
Winter 2014. So for now, it is mostly rough pre-draft notes, feel free to look around though.
